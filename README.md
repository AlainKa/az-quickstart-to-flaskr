# Azure quickstart to flaskr

The goal of this repository is to provide a sample flask application deployed on azure web app.

The repository can thus be edited in order to create new flasks web apps.

In order to ensure that through the all process the app is deploying correctly on azure web app we start from the azure web app tutorial.

Then we will go through edits, testing that the deployment is still functional, up until we have an hosted version of flaskr running on azure web apps.
